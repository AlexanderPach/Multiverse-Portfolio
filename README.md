# Multiverse-Portfolio

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Within these past 15 months, I've learned a tremendous amount of skills essential to my Software Engineering career. This goes from web development, CI/CD pipeline building, and RESTful APIs. I've planned on detailing these skills by showcasing what I have done during my time with Multiverse/AMEX. Before you scroll down, I would like to be appreciative of Multiverse for giving me this opportunity to begin with and am grateful for the amazing coaches they offer.</p>
